ProjectName - SmartGrade
SmartGrade is a simple C++ project that helps you track student records easily from your terminal.
You can add students, view all students, search, update, delete, and flag students who need help (marks below 40).

I made this project to practice C++ OOP and file handling in a clean, practical way.

Features: 

1) Add student

2) View all students

3) Search student

4) Update student

5) Delete student

6) Flag students with marks below 40

g++ main.cpp FileManager.cpp Student.cpp -o SmartGrade

Run:

Files: 

main.cpp – main program
